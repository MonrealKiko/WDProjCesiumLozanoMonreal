### Description on the HTML form, use and its elements:
### The HTML form that will be used in our website will take in information in the form of posting. By requesting information from the user, then using this information to be transformed in the form of an actual post which will be shown in other webpages. This HTML form will be able to take in text and/or an image. This is in line with the design of our website: A twitter/X-type website, being able to browse through different posts. Through the implementation of this HTML form, we will be able to increase the engagement of the user by making the user themselves update the website by adding their own personalized posts to the website.
